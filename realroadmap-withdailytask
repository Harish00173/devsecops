- You’ll be able to explain and demonstrate DevSecOps pipelines — a massive advantage in interviews.

Week 28 is where we step into Kubernetes Security (DevSecOps for K8s).
Up until now, you’ve been deploying workloads on Kubernetes — now you’ll secure them with runtime security (Falco), compliance scanning (kube-bench), penetration testing (kube-hunter), and Pod Security Standards (PSS/PSA).
This is a real differentiator → most candidates stop at K8s basics + Ingress. If you know K8s security tools, you’ll look like an engineer with 2+ years hands-on exposure.

Week 47 — Purple Teaming & Detection Engineering (Red↔Blue integration)
🎯 Goal:
Bridge offense and defense: run adversary emulation, build/validate detections, tune SIEM/SOAR playbooks, and turn attack findings into robust detection rules and automated responses. By week’s end you’ll be able to run a small Purple Team exercise, produce detection coverage mapped to MITRE ATT&CK, and deliver hardened detection rules + SOAR playbooks.

Day 1 — Purple Team Foundations & Planning
Topics
- What is Purple Teaming vs Red/Blue in isolation.
- Objectives for a Purple Team: measurable detection coverage, reduce dwell time, improve playbooks.
- Detection engineering workflow: threat → telemetry → detection rule → test → tune → onboard to SOAR.
Practice
- Choose 3 MITRE ATT&CK techniques (e.g., Credential Access: brute-force; Lateral Movement: SSH abuse; Exfiltration: S3 exfil).
- Create a Purple Team plan: success criteria, telemetry required (CloudTrail, K8s audit, Falco, ELK), timeframe.
Mini-Project
➡️ purple-plan/ — YAML/Markdown: chosen ATT&CK techniques, telemetry mapping, detection acceptance criteria.
Interview Qs
- What’s a Purple Team and why is it valuable?
- How do you choose which techniques to prioritize?

Day 2 — Telemetry Coverage & Data Engineering
Topics
- Telemetry sources and enrichment: logs, metrics, traces, process events, network flow.
- Log normalization, parsing, and enriching (add host, user, tags).
- Designing effective detections needs correct fields (user, src_ip, process, command_line, resource).
Practice
- Inventory your telemetry sources for the lab (CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs, Falco, K8s audit, Sysmon-like events for Linux).
- Write or improve a Fluent Bit/Fluentd configuration to add fields and route security-relevant logs into ELK/Loki or your SIEM.
Mini-Project
➡️ telemetry-coverage/ — Fluent Bit config + sample enriched logs and mapping doc.
Interview Qs
- Why is log enrichment important for detection accuracy?
- What fields are critical to detect lateral movement?

Day 3 — Detection Engineering: Rules & Queries
Topics
- Detection rule patterns: anomaly-based, signature-based, multi-source correlation.
- Writing queries for SIEM (ELK/Kibana, Sigma translation concept).
- Avoiding false positives: thresholding, whitelisting, baseline.
Practice
- Implement 3 detection rules targeting Day 1 ATT&CK techniques:
	- Failed SSH attempts > threshold in short time (CloudTrail/VPC/host logs).
	- Unusual S3 GETs from atypical source IP (CloudTrail + Geo enrichment).
	- Suspicious process exec in containers (Falco rule).
Mini-Project
➡️ detections/ — Kibana queries + Sigma-style YAML of rules + test dataset to validate.
Interview Qs

Day 4 — Test & Validate (Purple Exercise #1)
Topics
- Running controlled adversary emulation against the lab.
- Capture telemetry for each attack step; evaluate detection coverage and time-to-detect.
- Logging, evidence capture, and labeling.
Practice
- Execute Atomic Red Team or Caldera scenarios for your 3 techniques.
- For each technique record: attack timeline, raw events, which detections fired (if any), and missed signals.
Mini-Project
➡️ purple-exercise-1/ — attack scripts, execution timeline, detection results table (detected? time-to-detect? false positive count).
Interview Qs
- How do you measure detection effectiveness?
- What is Mean Time To Detect (MTTD) and why does it matter?

Day 5 — Triage, Alert Tuning & SOAR Playbook Development
Topics
- Triage workflow: enrich alert, investigate, escalate.
- Building SOAR playbooks for automated response (isolate host, rotate keys, block IP).
- Playbook idempotency & safe actions.
Practice
- Create a SOAR playbook for one alert (e.g., S3 exfil alert): enrich (who, where), run quick checks (CloudTrail confirm, list recent object downloads), then automated action (revoke temporary credentials / quarantine S3 object / notify Slack).
Mini-Project
➡️ soar-playbooks/ — JSON/YAML playbook for Shuffle/TheHive/Cortex or pseudo-code if tool not available + tests for idempotency/safety.
Interview Qs
- What steps should an automated playbook include for suspected credential compromise?
- How do you avoid dangerous auto-remediations?

Day 6 — Purple Exercise #2: Iterate, Harden & Document
Topics
- Re-run emulation, focusing on missed detection gaps from Day 4.
- Harden detection rules: add enrichment, cross-source correlation, adaptive thresholds.
- Document detection logic, tuning rationale, and create runbook entries for SOC analysts.
Practice
- Re-run attacks; confirm that tuned detections now catch them and that SOAR playbook responds as expected.
- Produce detection documentation with example alerts, required fields, false-positive examples, and triage steps.
Mini-Project
➡️ purple-exercise-2/ — final attack runs, before/after detection coverage comparison, updated rule files, runbooks for SOC.
Interview Qs
- How do you document a detection to be handed to an analyst?
- How do you prioritize detections to implement first?

- How would you scale these detections across multiple teams/accounts?

✅ End of Week 47 Deliverables
